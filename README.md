# AlgoTeach AI

AlgoTeach AI is an interactive educational platform that leverages AI to explain algorithmic concepts, complexity analysis, and pattern-matching techniques. It is built using Next.js and integrates LLM models to provide in-depth explanations and visualizations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Uses LLM models to break down complex algorithmic concepts.
- **Pattern Matching Analysis**: Demonstrates how different algorithms perform on various inputs.
- **Performance Metrics Visualization**: Provides insights into time and space complexity.
- **Interactive Playground**: Users can test algorithms and analyze their performance in real time.
